"""
Read plasma equilibrium for axisymmetric devices.
The data format stores the coordinates (R,Z) of the grid
in the poloidal plane of the device along with the value of the
radial, vectical, and toroidal components of the equilibrium magnetic
field as well as the density in the form

n m  # optional line
R1 R2 ... Rn
Z1 Z2 ... Zm
X(R1,Z1) X(R2,Z1) ... X(Rn, Z1)
X(R1,Z2) X(R2,Z2) ... X(Rn, Z2)
...
X(R1,Zm) X(R2,Zm) ... X(Rn, Zm)

where X stends for the components BR, BZ, and Btor of the magnetic field
in Tasla and the electron density density Ne in m^-3. 
Those quantities are stored in the files:

- B_V_x.txt for the radial component BR of the magnetic field;
- B_V_z.txt for the vertical component BZ of the magnetic field;
- B_Tbc_y.txt for the toroidal component Btor of the magnetic field;
- ne.txt for the electron density.

This module and the corresponding data format have been developed 
specifically for the TORPEX machine in the framework of the RFSCAT
EUROfusion Enabling Reasearch Project.
